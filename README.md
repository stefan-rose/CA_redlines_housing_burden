Project examining how history of redlining in CA cities correlates with housing burden in same areas by census tract. 

Data acquired from University of Richmond, Mapping Inequality database

Housing burden figures complied and distributed from CalEnviroScreen 3.0 distributed by CA OEHHA 
https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30

Of the cities examined, Los Angeles had the largest number of areas designated as "definitely declining" or "hazardous" (Grades C and D, respectively) by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the 1930s. LA had 167 neighborhoods marked as in "decline" and 71 neighborhoods as "hazardous." The visual correlation between housing burden in LA is quite striking. This repo contains the code to replicate the below map for LA, and similar maps for Oakland and San Diego.
